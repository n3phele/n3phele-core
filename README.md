n3phele-core
============

n3phele (pronounced nephele) is an open, extensible service that turns cloud resources into a workbench environment that can be accessed at https://n3phele.appspot.com from your pc, tablet or phone. 

Program execution is orchestrated in dynamically created cloud VMs, where any existing software transparently consumes and stores files stored in cloud object stores. Users can independently author and publish commands. Supported execution environments include EC2 and Openstack (HP Cloud). Supported object stores include S3 and Swift.

The code base for n3phele is open source to encourage contribution to, and improvement of, the on-line service.
